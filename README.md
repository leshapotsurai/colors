# colors
In this project, you have the ability to randomly generate colors by pressing the space bar or by refreshing the page. When you click on the padlock, the color is locked and when you press the spacebar again, the locked color remains unchanged. Also, when you click on the hex color code, this color is copied to the clipboard.
